BeatDetection Installation Overview

Quick Start
-----------

BeatDetection is a header-only C++ library, with no platform-specific dependencies. Include and use the file directly in your project.

Samples
-------

Several samples have been provided to demonstrate how BeatDetection can be used in production.

The samples currently run only on Windows, and require CMake and Visual Studio 2008 or 2010. Cross-platform samples are a work in progress.

Simply run cmake on the samples/ directory.
